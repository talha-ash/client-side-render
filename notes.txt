Points

[Point 1: MaxAGE effect is differ for index html and version assets.Browser send MaxAGE 0 for index 
html to do force revalidation. Revalidation is conditional request which use etag or last modified to
decide by server to send either 304 or 200 new file. For version file MaxAGE is what we set and browser not do revalidation.
After MaxAGE gone than it start conditional request to either serve from cache or server]
