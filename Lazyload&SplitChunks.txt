1. Two Types of Chunks

Initial chunks: Loaded immediately at startup (synchronous imports)
Async chunks: Loaded on-demand when needed (lazy loaded with import())

2. The Problem with chunks: 'initial'

Only extracts vendor code from the initial/main bundle
Dependencies inside lazy-loaded components stay bundled with them
Result: react-big-calendar remains inside contact.js instead of being extracted

3. The Solution: chunks: 'all'

Extracts vendor code from both initial and async chunks
Creates separate vendor chunks even for lazy-loaded dependencies
Result: vendor-react-big-calendar.js is created and can be cached separately

4. Real Benefit

Smaller lazy-loaded chunks (contact.js goes from 200 KB â†’ 50 KB)
Better caching: vendor libraries cached once, reused across all pages
Faster subsequent page loads when user navigates to lazy-loaded routes
